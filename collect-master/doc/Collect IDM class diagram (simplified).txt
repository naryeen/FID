IDM stays for Inventory Data Model and it's modeled by classes inside the package org.openforis.idm.metamodel

The main classes in this package are:
- Survey: it describes the whole survey definition. It contains a Schema object and a list of CodeList, ModelVersion, SpacialReferenceSystem objects.
- Schema: it describes the structure of the data. It contains a list of EntityDefinition objects (root entities). 
	In theory for every survey there can be more than one root entity.
- NodeDefinition: describes a node in the schema. It can be an EntityDefinition or an AttributeDefinition.
- EntityDefinition: describes an Entity in the survey. It can contain other NodeDefinition objects.
- AttributeDefinition: describes an Attribute in the survey. There are different subclasses of this class, one for every attribute type.
	Every AttributeDefinition can have Check objects associated.
- Check: describes a validation rule for a AttributeDefinition.

A Record in the database is an object that contains the actual data stored into the system and it's created by a Survey definition object.
The Record will be associated to one of the root EnityDefinition objects defined inside the Schema.
Every record will contain a root Entity object, that is related to one of the root EntityDefinition objects in the Schema associated to the survey.
In each Entity object there will be different Node objects, each one associated to a NodeDefinition in the Schema.
