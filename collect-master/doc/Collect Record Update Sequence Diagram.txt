The file Collect Record Update Sequence Diagram.pdf describes the interactions among objects when a attribute update request is received by
the server.

First of all, the client contacts the DataService object with a HTTP request.
It will get the active record object in the HTTP session, then it will ask the RecordUpdater to perform an update on the attribute's value.
The RecordUpdater will update the value in the attribute and will update all the dependent attributes, asking every involved DependencyGraph object.
For example, for the calculated attributes there is a DependencyGraph object that stores what are all the nodes that need to be recalculated 
when the value of another node changes.
The validations of all the dependent nodes are recalculated and a NodeChangeSet object is created and sent to the client as a response.
This NodeChangeSet object will contain a list of all the changes to be applied to every node related to the one that have been modified, including 
changes in the validation, relevance and requireness feedback.
